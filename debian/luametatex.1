.SH DESCRIPTION
Run LuaMetaTeX on TEXNAME, usually creating TEXNAME.pdf. Any remaining COMMANDS are processed as luatex input, after TEXNAME is read.

Alternatively, if the first non\-option argument begins with a backslash,
LuaMetaTeX interprets all non\-option arguments as an input line.

Alternatively, if the first non\-option argument begins with a &, the next word
is taken as the FMT to read, overriding all else. Any remaining arguments are
processed as above.

The LuaMetaTeX project is related to ConTeXt development. This macro package
tightly integrates TeX and MetaPost in close cooperation with Lua. Updates will
happen in sync with ConTeXt and when needed. Don't be fooled by unchanged dates:
long term stability is the objective.
